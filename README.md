# 🌟 Life in Weeks Timeline

This is a fun and visually interactive web app that helps you visualize your entire life — week by week — for up to 90 years. You can enter your birthdate, see how many weeks you've lived so far, and mark personal life events on specific weeks. You can also export/import your timeline data and download a PDF.

> Note: This project includes code developed with the assistance of ChatGPT for learning and implementation purposes.

## 🤖 AI Assistance

* Some parts of the JavaScript code were written or refined with the help of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). This helped in understanding complex logic and saving time during development. All code was reviewed, tested, and customized for this project.

* I used [Black Box.ai](https://www.blackbox.ai/) for polishing the UI.
